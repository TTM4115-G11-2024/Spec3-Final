# Here is the list of TODO:

## 19/04 - Sindre
* Created: a general Display class
* Takes: state as input (these are SenseHat states, not official stm)
* Added: "error" state
* Display two digits function works.
* Right now: adding content from "test_batterystatus.py" into "sensehat.py".

### Tested:
* error() works
* two digits display works
** battery status updating works

### Next time:
* Complete "Charging" state
* Continue on the other states.
* Check that the self. is implemented correctly
